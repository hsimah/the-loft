# Raspberry Pi Provisioning — viking & fjord

Provisioning guide for The Loft's Raspberry Pi 3 B+ fleet. Both devices (`viking` and `fjord`) get identical configuration: same user/group model as space-needle, Docker, howlr (Snapcast client), snoot (Beszel agent), and shared shell configs.

---

## 1. Overview

| Hostname | Role | Location |
|----------|------|----------|
| `viking` | Snapcast client + Beszel agent | TBD room in The Loft |
| `fjord` | Snapcast client + Beszel agent | TBD room in The Loft |

Pis run:
1. **Howlr audio clients** — `snapclient` via Docker Compose (`client` profile) to play synchronized audio from space-needle's `snapserver`
2. **Snoot** — Beszel agent reporting host metrics back to the houstn hub

---

## 2. Prerequisites (on your laptop)

**Generate an SSH deploy key** — done later on the Pi itself (Phase C)

---

## 3. OS Installation

Use **Raspberry Pi Imager** to flash **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit, Bookworm)** onto each Pi's SD card.

### Imager settings (gear icon / Ctrl+Shift+X)

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Hostname | `viking` or `fjord` |
| Enable SSH | Yes, public-key only |
| SSH public key | `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (your key) |
| Username | `adminhabl` |
| Password | Set a temporary password (SSH key is primary) |
| WiFi SSID | Your network SSID |
| WiFi password | Your network password |
| WiFi country | US |
| Locale | en_US.UTF-8, timezone America/Los_Angeles |

### Write and boot

1. Insert SD card into your computer
2. Open Raspberry Pi Imager, select OS and storage
3. Apply the settings above
4. Write the image
5. Remove SD card from laptop
6. Insert SD card into the Pi and power on

---

## 4. Initial SSH Access

After first boot (~60 seconds), the Pi should be reachable via mDNS:

```bash
ssh adminhabl@viking.local
# or
ssh adminhabl@fjord.local
```

If mDNS doesn't resolve, find the Pi's IP from your router's DHCP lease table.

Once connected, verify the hostname:

```bash
hostname    # should print viking or fjord
uname -m    # should print aarch64
```

---

## 5. Deploy Key and Clone Repo

1. Install git (needed before `setup.sh` can run):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git
   ```

2. Generate an SSH key on the Pi:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<hostname>-deploy-key" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

3. Copy the public key output, then on GitHub:
   - Go to `hsimah/the-loft` → Settings → Deploy keys → Add deploy key
   - Title: `viking` (or `fjord`)
   - Key: paste the public key
   - Allow write access: No (read-only is fine)

4. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /srv/the-loft
   sudo chown adminhabl:adminhabl /srv/the-loft
   git clone git@github.com:hsimah/the-loft.git /srv/the-loft
   ```

---

## 6. Configure .env Files

### howlr (skip until server is ready)

Don't create `services/howlr/.env`. `setup.sh` will warn and skip howlr, which is correct until the server side on space-needle is ready.

### snoot

```bash
cd /srv/the-loft
cp services/snoot/.env.example services/snoot/.env
```

`BESZEL_KEY` and `BESZEL_TOKEN` are populated from the Beszel hub UI after first launch — see the Fleet Monitoring section in the main README.

---

## 7. Run setup.sh

```bash
cd /srv/the-loft
sudo bash setup.sh
```

The script will:
- Install system packages (git, curl, jq)
- Skip storage mount (none configured in `hosts/viking/host.conf`)
- Create groups (`pack-member`)
- Create users (`littledog` with `audio` group, `adminhabl`)
- Harden SSH (`AllowUsers adminhabl`, disable password auth)
- Configure sudo for `adminhabl`
- Set up shared bashrc.d sourcing
- Install Docker CE
- Configure Docker log rotation
- Start snoot (Beszel agent)
- Warn and skip howlr (no `.env`)

The script is idempotent — safe to re-run at any time.

---

## 8. Post-Setup Verification

### Set adminhabl password

```bash
sudo passwd adminhabl
```

### Require a password for adminhabl sudo

`adminhabl` is the initial (imager) user, so Raspberry Pi OS grants it passwordless sudo via drop-in files. Remove them so sudo requires the password you just set (matching `setup.sh`'s `/etc/sudoers.d/adminhabl`):

```bash
sudo rm -f /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users
```

Verify sudo now prompts:

```bash
sudo -k; sudo echo test
# Expected: prompts for adminhabl's password
```

### Verify SSH hardening

```bash
sudo sshd -T | grep -E 'allowusers|passwordauthentication'
# Expected: allowusers adminhabl / passwordauthentication no
```

### Verify Docker

```bash
sudo docker run --rm hello-world
```

### Verify shared bashrc.d

```bash
exit
ssh adminhabl@viking.local
# Prompt should show the shared format
```

## 9. User & Group Model

Identical to space-needle:

| User | UID | Primary Group | Shell | Additional Groups | Role |
|------|-----|---------------|-------|-------------------|------|
| `littledog` | 1003 | `pack-member` (1003) | `/usr/sbin/nologin` | `docker`, `audio` | Service account for containers |
| `adminhabl` | auto | `adminhabl` | `/bin/bash` | `sudo`, `docker`, `pack-member` | SSH login + admin; manages repo, sudo for privileged actions |

**Differences from space-needle:**
- `littledog` gets `audio` group (for howlr sound output) but **not** `render` or `video` (no GPU workloads)
- No Pawpcorn, stellarr, or pupyrus services

---

## 10. SSH Hardening

The setup script applies:

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `AllowUsers adminhabl` | Only adminhabl can SSH in | Same as space-needle |
| `PasswordAuthentication no` | Disabled | Key-only access; Pis are on WiFi and more exposed |

---

## 11. Docker

Docker CE is installed via the official apt repository (same method as space-needle). The setup script also installs:
- `daemon.json` from the repo for log rotation (10m max-size, 3 files)
- Docker group membership for `littledog` and `adminhabl`

---

## 12. Directory Structure

Pis use a simpler layout than space-needle (no `/mammoth` volume, no `/opt` service configs):

```
/srv/the-loft/                      Git clone of the repo
  setup.sh                          Unified host provisioner
  hosts/viking/host.conf            Host configuration (services, users, storage)
  services/
    howlr/
      docker-compose.yml            Compose file (client profile for Pis)
      .env                          Secrets (gitignored, created later)
    snoot/
      docker-compose.yml            Beszel agent compose
      .env                          Secrets (gitignored, populated from hub UI)
```

No additional directories are created.

---

## 13. Shared Shell Config (bashrc.d)

The setup script adds a `source` line to `adminhabl`'s `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
source /srv/the-loft/bashrc.d
```

This gives both users the shared prompt, aliases, key bindings, and nano config from the repo. The bashrc.d resolves `__REPO_DIR` dynamically via `BASH_SOURCE[0]`, so aliases like `loft-ctl` and `nano --rcfile` resolve correctly regardless of clone path.

---

## 14. WiFi Power Management

WiFi power saving causes audio dropouts when snapclient is running. Disable it:

```bash
# Immediate
sudo iw wlan0 set power_save off

# Persistent (via NetworkManager dispatcher)
sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-wifi-powersave <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
iw wlan0 set power_save off
EOF
sudo chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-wifi-powersave
```

**Note:** Only needed when howlr/snapclient is deployed. Skip this step until then. If the Pi uses wired Ethernet, this step is unnecessary.

---

## 15. Future: howlr (snapclient)

When the howlr server side is deployed on space-needle, each Pi will run `snapclient` via Docker Compose:

1. Create the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp services/howlr/.env.example services/howlr/.env
   nano services/howlr/.env
   # Set SNAPSERVER_HOST, SOUND_DEVICE, HOST_ID
   ```

2. Re-run setup or start manually:
   ```bash
   cd /srv/the-loft
   sudo bash setup.sh
   # or manually:
   sudo docker compose -f services/howlr/docker-compose.yml --profile client up -d
   ```

3. Apply WiFi power management fix (section 14)

The howlr compose file uses profiles — Pis use the `client` profile (snapclient only), while space-needle uses the `server` profile (snapserver + shairport-sync + librespot).
